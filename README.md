# Y-Term - A Terminal Based Youtube Application

This application does not use the YouTube API and it is ad free.
It is still a work in progress. 

How to use: 
1) put the .vim file in your /usr/share/vim/vimfiles/plugin directory 
2) put the .sh file anywhere you want and create a file called yterm.txt in the same directory 

Note: you must have the following installed for it to work (or you can mod the code to work with other programs)
- bash terminal
- vim
- mpv media player (or any, just edit code to use whatever player you want)
- ffmpeg
- youtube-dl
- curl
- .vim file must be in /usr/share/vim/vimfiles/profiles
- yterm.txt & yterm.sh files must share the same directory
